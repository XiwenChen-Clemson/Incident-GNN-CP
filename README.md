# Incident-GNN-CP
The official code for the paper: Enhancing Graph Neural Networks in Large-scale Traffic Incident Analysis with Concurrency Hypothesis

## How to run
Put the code ```maincls-city.py``` and ```maincls-state.py``` to the folder ```code``` in [TAP official Repo](https://github.com/baixianghuang/travel).
Then simply run them. The dependencies are the same as [TAP official Repo](https://github.com/baixianghuang/travel).
**All 12 GNN models with their enhanced version (-cp) are included.**
